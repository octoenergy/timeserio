#Tensorflow docker files

Official tensorflow docker images doesn't really fit our needs as they depend on python3.5 rather than pyton3.6. For this reason two docker files can be find in the `dockerfiles` folder, one for a cpu image and another for gpu image. 

These images live publicly in our (docker hub )[https://hub.docker.com/r/octoenergy/tensorflow/].
